Day 3 ( Maxi Prep )
Materials :
	- Pure link plasmid Maxiprep kit
	- Red tube holder 
	- white tubes with Lids
	1. Grab culture beakers and pour in tube 
	2. Place in larger black rotor ( in 4 ° C room )
	3. Place in large centrifuge and spin at 4000g for 10 minutes
	4. Pour bleach in flasks and let sit for 10 minutes
	5. Equilibrate columns (w/ bottom to catch)
		- Place columns on rack 
		- Add 30mls in each column and let it all drip 
	6. Grab tubes from centrifuge and pour SN into flasks with bleach and let sit for at least 10 minutes
	7. Resuspend the pellets in 10mls of R3 for each pellet ( be careful to not get pellet stuck)
	8. Move it to 50mL eppendorf tube
	9. Add bleach to big tubes ( 10 % ) , close and shake
	10. Add 10ml of lysis buffer to each tube and this gently by inverting tubes
	11. Let tubes sit for 5 minutes
	12. Wash flasks & tubes with water white waiting (rinsing multiple times)
	11. Add 10mls of N3 ( precipitation buffer ) and mix by inverting quite a few times (20ish times)
	12. Spin tubes in ultra centrifuge for 10 minutes at 12000g 
	13. Use 10 mL pipettes to transfer SN and load onto column ( Avoiding all precipitate )
	- Throw tubes with precipitate
	14. Wait until everything tips out of column
	15. Add 60mL wash buffer to each column
	16. Wait until all wash buffer passes through and discard flow through (dump and rinse with water)
	17. Add 15mL elution buffer ( EU ) to each column to allow to drain into tubes ( which will contain the purified DNA )
	18. Grab isopropanol alcohol from flame cupboard
	19. Add 10.5ml isopropanol to each tube and invert a couple & times
	20. Throw away columns
	21. Spin Eppendorf tubes at 12000g for 30 minutes in ultra centrifuge
	22. Discard SN ASAP by tilting tube and dumping down sink
	23. Add 500uL 70% ethanol to each tube and mix couple of times
	24. Transfer to the 1.5mL Eppendorf tube 
	25. Spin at 12000g for 30 minutes
