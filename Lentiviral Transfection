Thawing HEK293T week before:
	1. Thaw cells in tube from liquid nitrogen and place in water bath 
	2. Once almost thawed, transfer cells to 15mL eppendorf tube
	3. Add media
	4. Spin cells at 400rcf for 4 minutes
	5. Remove supernatant
	6. Transfer cells to 15cm TC plate with 20mL media
Splitting HEK293T:
	1. Aspirate media
	2. Add 5mL trypsin (T/E) to plate
	3. Place in incubator for 3-4 minutes 
	4. Also in 10mL media to pipette up and down in plate a few times to make sure all cells are grabbed
	5. Place in 15mL tube
	6. Spin at 400rcf for 4 minutes
	7. Aspirate supernatant
	8. Split into 3 (Depending on size of pellet) 15cm plate
Plate cells (day 0):
	1. Aspirate media
	2. Add 5mL of trypsin
	3. Incubate in incubator for 3-4 minutes
	4. Add ~ 5mL media to each plate to inactivate trypsin
	5. And pipette up and down a few time 
	6. Transfer to tube 
	7. Spin of 400 rcf for 5 minutes 
	8. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 20mLs of media
	9. Count cells and plate about 12 million cells in each plate 
Transfection (day 1):
	- MDG2 <- backbone, PSPAX <- packaging system, plasmid
	1. Get plasmids on ice
	2. Quantify using nanodrop 200 software and calculate DNA concentration for each
		a. Blank: T/E buffer
		b. Make sure DNA checked
	3. Go to 15cm dlightab on excel and add the Plasmids for each to get the plasmid volumes
	4. Spray and bring vortex into hood ( & plug in )
	5. Grab a 15cm tube for each virus and label
	6. Add 630μL TE buffer to each tube 
	7. Add specified amount of plasmid to each tube
	8. Add 350μl of MQH2O to tuber and mix
	9. Add 113 of CaCl2 to tube and mix well by pipetting
	10. Add 1140μL of HeBs dropwise while tube is on vortex
	- 1000+ 140 ( have both pipettes + tips ready )
	11. Let sit for 5-15 minutes at room temp .
	12. Dropwise add 1.5 mL of to each plate and swirl
Media Change (day 2) 
	- Make sure wearing lab coat and glasses
	1. Grab 5% bleach in a glass beaker in hood
		- Bleach diluted with water
	2. Grab virus disposable box + 1 disposable pipette per plate into hood
	3. Use disposable pipette to get media from plate and put in bleach container
	4. Put pipette in bleach container and suck up media and then leave it there
	5. Add media into place using a glass pipette
	6. Once done with all plates, put disposable pipettes into virus box 
		- Can leave closed box in hood for next day use
Collecting Virus (day 3 and 4)
	1. Grab 5% bleach in a glass beaker
	2. Use disposable pipettes to transfer media from plate to a 50mL tube
	3. Spin at 2400rcf for 10 minutes
	4. Transfer the media to a new tube (making sure to not get the cells at the bottom)
	5. Add 2mLs of PEG-IT to tube
	6. Invert tubes a couple of times and place in fridge
		a. At least need 24hr incubation 
	7. If day 3: add 20mL of fresh media, if day 4: add 5mL of bleach to plate and discard after a bit
Concentrating Virus:
	1. Spin tubes at 4 degree at 3000g for 30 minutes
	2. Place 5% black in beaker in hood
	3. Tip and put supernatant for each tube into bleach
	4. Put tubes upside down over paper towel
		a. Remove tubes from paper towel and put in bleach
	5. Use cold PBS and add 400UL to each tube
	6. Pipette up and down and take to next tube which contains the same
		a. Make sure to bleach tubes
	7. Aliquot 100uL in cryo tubes at store at -80
